# Public-school-safety
We will be creating a code that will help make public places and schools secure.The way we will be doing this is by using motion dectors and cameras. The camera will be used by the security department to see who enters and exits the premise. The sensors will detect any material .05 miles away from the premise. Our purpouse of this code is to reduce gun violence in our enviorment by creating a secure and happy enviorment for the public.
